## GridFieldRelationHandler

This module provides two [`GridField`](http://doc.silverstripe.org/framework/en/topics/grid-field) components
that aid in managing relationships within [SilverStripe](http://www.silverstripe.org). The 
[`GridFieldHasOneRelationHandler`](#gridfieldhasonerelationhandler) component allows a `SS_List` to be used to select the value of a has_one
relation and the [`GridFieldManyRelationHandler`](#gridfieldmanyrelationhandler) component manages a `RelationList`.

## Installation ##

If the version of SilverStripe you are running is earlier than 3.0.3, first apply [this patch](https://github.com/silverstripe/sapphire/commit/d2b4e0df01f82fdbe613890c8ae909af404640a5) to `GridFieldPaginator`.

Download this module and extract it into your site's root folder. Flush your site's manifest by visiting
http://yoursite.com/?flush=1. These components are now ready for use.

## GridFieldHasOneRelationHandler ##

![](https://files.app.net/zb9sU5vs.png)

The `GridFieldHasOneRelationHandler` component provides radio buttons for selecting the object that the
has_one points to. Its constructor takes the object the relation exists on, the name of the relation and
an optional target fragment which describes the position of the save relation button.

### Example ###

	:::php
	$config->addComponent(new GridFieldHasOneRelationHandler($this, 'MainImage'));

If you want the ability to select no item, add a row to your database with the ID of 0.

## GridFieldManyRelationHandler ##

![](https://files.app.net/zb9r7VqE.png)

The `GridFieldManyRelationHandler` component provides check boxes for selecting the objects that a
has_many or many_many point to. Its constructor takes an optional target fragment which describes
the position of the save relation button.

If your `GridField` also has a `GridFieldPaginator` component, this component must be inserted before
it for the pagination to work properly.

### Example ###

	:::php
	// The second argument here ensures that this component is placed before any GridFieldPaginator
	$config->addComponent(new GridFieldManyRelationHandler(), 'GridFieldPaginator');
